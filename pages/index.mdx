## 1. Ranking my 5 most favourite and 5 least favourite support tasks
### Most Favourite

**1. A reliable personal contact for customers**

Building relationships and trust with customers is very important as I find that once a relationship is established it is easier for both me and the client. This means that customers have a fixed contact person and do not have to communicate information twice, and as their contact person, I can find my way around the customer projects more quickly and can help more efficiently than if they had to contact a random team member every time.

**2. Work with people to figure out if Vercel is suitable for their use case**

At my current job, I enjoy working with the sales team to advise customers on how they can use our product for their project. Vercel's product offering is much more diverse than my current company's, so I look forward to finding creative solutions on how to implement Vercel's products for a variety of use cases and cover as many project needs as possible.

**3. Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use**

Something I really enjoy is making sure that solutions are logged properly and solving problems that were difficult to solve and providing the solution to my colleagues so that they may not need as much time on the same problem. But rather be able to solve this more quickly. Since a fix/improvement of a process always takes a certain amount of time after it has been passed on to the relevant departments.
But I also find it fulfilling to inform the departments with suggested solutions or process optimizations for problems.

**4. Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project**

I think this is essential in most support engineer roles as there may be something in the logs that indicates the issue at hand.

**5. Respond to 50+ support request via email ervery day**

Something I really enjoy about my job is working on a wide range of topics, both in terms of the problems themselves and their complexity.

### Least Favourite

**1. Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case**

Creating videos to demonstrate things to customers would be something I would currently feel very uncomfortable about, as I have never created videos in which I was the main actor. Hearing your own voice is a little strange, but over time you get used to it. However, I have experience in video editing and with a possible refresher, I would definitely be willing to learn something and gain experience in it.

**2. Manage a support team**

I currently enjoy working as an engineer and do not want to go into management at this point in my career. Maybe this would be something for the future. Nevertheless, I like to help less experienced colleagues and support them wherever I can

**3. Run ticket review sessions to make sure tone is consistent**

I know how important it is to represent the company well and provide accurate answers to the questions asked. I would probably like to do this after shadowing a colleague or receiving relevant training

**4. Write and maintain support articles and docs pages**

I know how important it is to represent the company well and write good and accurate articles. I would probably like to do this after shadowing a colleague or receiving relevant training

**5. Help train and onboard new support teammates**

Supporting new colleagues is not a problem for me, but I should first have experience in the new environment and the company before I train new team members and perhaps even look over the shoulder of an experienced colleague


## 2. What I want to learn or do more of at work

Get involved in platform development. For example, through conversations or meetings with teams working on the platform and discussing how things could be improved for the customer.

Support teams often have really good insight into common customer issues, which is critical to developing a more customer-friendly and intuitive platform.

## 3. How I solved a technical issue in a previous role and determined the solution was succesful

During my current role, I had an issue where several customers complained that after changing the language of the site they were logged out again. Unfortunately we were unable to reproduce the problem.
That's why I asked the customer to describe to us exactly the steps that led to the logout. In the meantime, of course, I searched more intensively for the problem and found that if you changed the language immediately after logging in, you would be redirected to the login page. I sent this to the relevant department with a precise description and also communicated to the customer that we had found the error and explained where the error was and which step he had to take so that it didn't happen again and that it would be the next step update is fixed.

## 4. When I would choose to use Edge Functions, Serverless Functions, or Edge Middleware with Vercel

### Edge Functions

I would use Edge Functions for simple functions that run on dynamic parts of the site after the site has already loaded, as they run after the cache is deployed. For example, I would use them to retrieve specific user data or perform dynamic rewrites. Edge functions tend to be much faster than serverless functions
### Serverless Functions

I would choose to use serverless functions if a function is particularly resource intensive or if they need access to a part of the Node.js API. For example, I would probably use a serverless function if I was processing large amounts of data or making large API requests would edit.
### Edge Middleware

I would choose to use Edge Middleware to execute code that can be run before a request is received.

A simple case would be to have a personalized static page for every country. Now when a request comes in, look at the geo location data and redirect visitors to the personalized country page. Or maybe the site have an events section on the page. Send people to a personalized page with events near them.

## 5. Responding to a customer requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that I've not seen before. How I would begin to troubleshoot this and what I would ask the customer.


I would look through both internal and external documents related to the framework/technology, as well as look up specific build issues online to see if others have faced this and if there are any solutions to it. If I get stuck, I would ask colleagues who have specialist knowledge of the framework/technology.

I would ask the customer for screenshots of the error code:

* Could you provide the exact error message you are seeing or a screenshot of the build issue?
* Could you also describe to me the steps that led to the error so that we can recreate the problem.

If I have found specific solutions for specific environments or versions of frameworks/software based on my initial troubleshooting, I would share this with the customer.

## 6. Responding to the customer from the previous question if they're frustrated about having to answer questions



> Hey XXX,
>
> Max here from the Vercel’s support team.
>
> I completely understand your frustration and am very sorry for the inconvenience caused by this issue. I know answering a lot of questions can be tedious, especially if you've spent a lot of time getting it to work.
>
> However, to ensure that we can conduct a thorough investigation on our part and resolve the issue efficiently, we need some more details about the issue.
>
> Rest assured, as soon as we have further details, we will dig deeper into the issue and get to the bottom of it for you.
>
> Best Regards,
>
> Max

## 7. Responding to the customer asking to setup a redirect and justification


> Hey XXX,
>
> Max here from the Vercel’s support team.
> This varies slightly depending on whether you want a permanent redirect or a temporary redirect. You should set this to “Permanent” if you intend for this redirect to remain indefinitely, or “Temporary” if you intend to either change or remove the redirect in the future. For more information about the different types of redirect status codes we support, see [here](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/redirects#redirect-status-codes).
>
>If you want this to be a permanent redirect you should add the below code to your projects vercel.json config file:
>```
> {
>  "redirects": [
>    {
>      "source": "/blog",
>      "destination": "https://example.com"
>    }
>  ]
> }
>```
>
> If you want this to be a temporary redirect you should add an additional line defining the permanent variable as false, for example:
>```
> {
>  "redirects": [
>    {
>      "source": "/blog",
>      "destination": "https://example.com"
>      "permanent": false
>    }
>  ]
>}
>```
>
> You can find more examples of many different types of redirects, as well as other variables you can set, you can find [here](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#redirects).
>
> I hope i could help!
>
> Best Regards,
>
> Max

 <br />

*As the user didn’t mention if they wanted the redirect to be permanent or temporary I included examples of both to prevent them from accidentally adding the incorrect type of redirect. I’m also assuming that providing code to add to the config file is within the scope of Vercel’s support as I’m not yet aware of it.*

## 8. Responding to a customer not wanting there site to be indexed and justification

> Hey XXX,
>
> Max here from the Vercel’s support team.
>
> Vercel Preview Deployments are not indexed by search engines by default because the X-Robots-Tag HTTP header is set to noindex. When search engines attempt to crawl a page with this header present they will observe it and stop it from being indexed.
>
>  If you are using a Custom Domain that is assigned to a non-Production Branch, however, the header X-Robots-Tag: noindex will not be set.. You can find an example on how to do that via Edge Middleware [here](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/edge-functions-add-header).
>
>You can confirm whether this header is present on your site by running the below CURL command in your operating system’s terminal, replacing the domain as needed:
> ```
> curl -I https://yourdomain.com/
> ```
>
> If the header is present, you should see the following in the command output:
> ```
> x-robots-tag: noindex
> ```
> For further guidance on how we handle indexing of preview deployments, see [here](https://vercel.com/guides/are-vercel-preview-deployment-indexed-by-search-engines).
>
> If you have any further questions on this topic, please do not hesitate to contact use and wish you a great day!
>
> Best Regards,
>
> Max

## 9. What I think a common problem Vercel support receive is and how I would help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term

I would suspect that one of the most common problems is related to platform deployment and management.

* Short term solutions could be providing good documentation, tutorials and instructions.
* Long term could be improving the usability of the platform and offering training/workshops.


## 10. How I think the familiarisation exercise could be improved or altered

The exercise is very good for familiarizing yourself with the platform and the documentation. But it is very difficult to take the time to answer all the questions correctly.

You may be able to delete 1-2 questions.
